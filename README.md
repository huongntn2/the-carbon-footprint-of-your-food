# The Carbon Footprint of Your Food

This analysis examines the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across the supply chain for major food categories, from beef production through fruits and vegetables. Leveraging detailed life cycle assessment data encompassing 43 key foods, it benchmarks contributions from agriculture, land use conversion, animal feed, processing, transportation, and packaging. By evaluating both total emission magnitudes per kilogram and distribution across supply chain stages, the relative climate impact of our diets gets revealed â€”along with potential high-impact mitigation points.
